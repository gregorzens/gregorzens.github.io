<p style = "margin-bottom:20px;"><font  size="7" >  Gregor Zens <br> </font> </p>
  
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA)](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/), where I work with [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/).  Previously, I worked as a postdoc at the Institute for Statistics and Mathematics at [WU Vienna](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/) with [Sylvia Frühwirth-Schnatter](https://www.wu.ac.at/statmath/faculty-staff/faculty/sfruehwirthschnatter). I obtained my PhD in economics with a focus on Bayesian econometrics at [WU Vienna](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/), under the supervision of [Jésus Crespo Cuaresma](https://www.wu.ac.at/economics/mitarbeiter-innen/crespo-j) and [Sylvia Frühwirth-Schnatter](https://www.wu.ac.at/statmath/faculty-staff/faculty/sfruehwirthschnatter). I have also served as a statistical consultant for the [International Bank of Reconstruction and Development](https://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are/ibrd) and the [International Finance Corporation](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home) within the [World Bank Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home).


<p style = "margin-bottom:5px;"> <font size="5" > <br>  Research Focus  </font></p>

My main research interest lies in Bayesian econometrics and statistics, with an emphasis on applied probabilistic modeling and computational methods. I predominantly collaborate with economists, statisticians, climate researchers and demographers, preferably focusing on applications connected to the field of development. See below for some on-going and past projects.

<p style = "margin-bottom:5px;"> <font size="5" > <br>  Teaching & Thesis Supervision  </font></p>

I have taught several B.Sc. level courses on basic econometrics and linear modeling, on economic development, economic growth and on macroeconomic theory. I have also held M.Sc. level lectures on macroeconometric methods with a focus on Bayesian computation. In addition, I have supervised a number of bachelor's and master's theses from the realm of empirical economics; topics included for instance _The importance of digitized government-to-person (G2P) payments for women's financial inclusion in developing countries_ and _Nowcasting GDP growth in Austria via the construction of a daily economic sentiment index using Google Trends_.
