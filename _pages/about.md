<p style = "margin-bottom:20px;"><font  size="7" >  Gregor Zens <br> </font> </p>
  
I am a research scholar at the [International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)](https://iiasa.ac.at/), where I am part of the [Population and Just Societies (POPJUS)](https://iiasa.ac.at/programs/popjus) program. Previously, I worked at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA)](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/) with [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/) and at the Institute for Statistics and Mathematics at [WU Vienna](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/) with [Sylvia Frühwirth-Schnatter](https://www.wu.ac.at/statmath/faculty-staff/faculty/sfruehwirthschnatter). I obtained my PhD in economics with a focus on Bayesian econometrics at [WU Vienna](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/), under the supervision of [Jésus Crespo Cuaresma](https://www.wu.ac.at/economics/mitarbeiter-innen/crespo-j) and [Sylvia Frühwirth-Schnatter](https://www.wu.ac.at/statmath/faculty-staff/faculty/sfruehwirthschnatter) and have also served as a statistical consultant for the [International Bank of Reconstruction and Development](https://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are/ibrd) and the [International Finance Corporation](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home) within the [World Bank Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home).


<p style = "margin-bottom:5px;"> <font size="5" > <br>  Research Focus  </font></p>

My research focus is on developing empirical models to analyze social science phenomena, often using Bayesian methods. I predominantly collaborate with economists, statisticians, climate researchers and demographers, preferably focusing on applications connected to human development. Methodologically, my main interest lies in econometrics and statistics, with an emphasis on applied probabilistic modeling and computational methods. See below for some on-going and past projects.

<p style = "margin-bottom:5px;"> <font size="5" > <br>  Teaching & Thesis Supervision  </font></p>

I have taught several B.Sc. level courses on basic econometrics and linear modeling, on economic development, economic growth and on macroeconomic theory. I have also held M.Sc. level lectures on macroeconometric methods with a focus on Bayesian computation. In addition, I have supervised a number of bachelor's and master's theses from the realm of empirical economics; topics included for instance _The importance of digitized government-to-person (G2P) payments for women's financial inclusion in developing countries_ and _Nowcasting GDP growth in Austria via the construction of a daily economic sentiment index using Google Trends_.
